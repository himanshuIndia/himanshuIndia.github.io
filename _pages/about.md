I am a passionate researcher in the field of Machine Learning, currently pursuing my Ph.D. at IIIT Delhi where I am a part of [Visual Conception Group](https://vcg.iiitd.edu.in/). With a specific focus on adversarial attacks, I delve deep into understanding the vulnerabilities of machine learning models and devising robust defenses against malicious manipulations. Under the guidance of Dr. AV Subramanyam, I am fortunate to be at the forefront of groundbreaking research.

Prior to my doctoral journey, I gained invaluable industry experience as a Research Scientist at [Animaker](https://www.animaker.com/). Working in a dynamic environment, I honed my skills in applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to real-world problems. I worked on building the text to video tool [Steve AI](https://www.steve.ai/) This experience provided me with a practical perspective and strengthened my ability to bridge the gap between academia and industry.

Thank you for visiting my website. I am always open to exciting opportunities and collaborations. Together, let's shape the future of machine learning and defend against adversarial attacks.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations. I look forward to connecting with you!
