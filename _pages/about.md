Welcome to my website!

I am a passionate researcher in the field of Machine Learning, currently pursuing my Ph.D. at IIIT Delhi. With a specific focus on adversarial attacks, I delve deep into understanding the vulnerabilities of machine learning models and devising robust defenses against malicious manipulations. Under the guidance of Dr. AV Subramanyam, I am fortunate to be at the forefront of groundbreaking research.

Prior to my doctoral journey, I gained invaluable industry experience as a Research Scientist at Animaker. Working in a dynamic environment, I honed my skills in applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to real-world problems. This experience provided me with a practical perspective and strengthened my ability to bridge the gap between academia and industry.

My passion for exploring the intricacies of machine learning and the security challenges it faces has fueled my ambition to make a meaningful impact. Through my research, I strive to create innovative solutions that fortify the integrity and reliability of machine learning systems in the face of adversarial threats.

Beyond academia and research, I am deeply committed to sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration. I am a dedicated mentor and advocate for diversity and inclusivity in STEM fields. I firmly believe in empowering aspiring researchers and fostering a supportive community where everyone can thrive.

Thank you for visiting my website. I am always open to exciting opportunities and collaborations. Together, let's shape the future of machine learning and defend against adversarial attacks.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations. I look forward to connecting with you!
